# Star Wars: The Clone Wars (SLUS-20510)

This patch separates everything but the "movies" directory from the disc image. Loading times are somewhat better, and considering how extremely rushed and broken this game is, I wouldn't be surprised if it fixed something else somewhere. How was this game able to be released in such a broken, unfinished state when all other Star Wars games of the time were incredibly polished? This game SERIOUSLY needed another whole year of development.
