# Partial Host Filesystem Patches

These patches mostly separate a game from its original disc image, but still need access to it or a different disc image in order to work properly. Simply apply the LunarIPS patch to the specified executable, delete the SYSTEM.CNF file, turn on "Enable Host Filesystem" in PCSX2 2.0+, follow the rest of the installation instructions listed in the main directory, and in most cases you're all set!
